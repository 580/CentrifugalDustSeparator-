Files adjusted for UK tube: https://plasticonline.co.uk/150mm-diameter-clear-acrylic-tube.html
<br>Print the mirrored impeller with the OrcaSlicer file clockwise for clean print results.


I adjusted the MK2 files to the UK tube dimensions:

    Wall thickness: 3.1mm
    OD: 150.05mm
    ID: 144.16mm

*had to scale down MK2_UK_impeller-shroud.3mf (along with the impeller) to 99.9 as at 100% it was just too snug to push further down the tube past the opening.
